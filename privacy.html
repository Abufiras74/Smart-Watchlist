## Privacy Policy – Smart Watchlist

**Effective Date:** April 23, 2025

### Overview
Smart Watchlist is a Chrome extension that allows users to save stock tickers, personal notes, and sentiment tags for investment tracking and organization. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data.

### What Information We Collect
We do **not collect**, transmit, or store any personal data or user information on external servers. All data—including watchlist items, notes, and sentiment—is stored **locally** in your browser using Chrome's `localStorage`.

### How Your Data Is Used
Your data is used solely within your own device to display and manage your custom watchlist. The extension does not use analytics, does not connect to any remote server, and does not share your data with third parties.

### Permissions
We request the `"storage"` permission only to save your data locally on your browser. This ensures that your watchlist persists between sessions.

### Data Sharing
We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties. We do not use ads or tracking scripts of any kind.

### Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy as the extension evolves. All updates will be reflected on this page and, if significant, will be communicated via the extension’s update notes.
